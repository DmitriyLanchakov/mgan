# Masking GAN - Generating image attribute mask

## Motivation


## Data
I have used CelebA dataset to train the model. There two files you would need to reproduce results: _img\_align\_celeba.zip_ and _list\_attr\_celeba.txt_

You can download them from here http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html and put into {PROJECT_DIR}/data
